# Swiftie
My data 115 project focuses on Taylor Swift's music catalog.
No matter who you are in 2023 you know who Taylor Swift is, Times 2023 Person of the Year and new member of the billionaire club. The Eras Tour is an international phenomenon. Taylor Swift has spent the last few years rerecording her first 6 albums after her masters were sold off. These re-records of the albums and for the most part the same songs have become more popular than the originals, as shown in my project. 
We will look at all of her released music including the stolen versions and Taylor's Version up to Speak Now (Taylor's Version). We will look at the danceability and popularity of each album. We will look at whether danceability affects popularity or not. 



danceability - Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.

popularity - the popularity of the song from 0 to 100

valence - A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).
