# Swiftie
My data 115 project focuses on Taylor Swift's music catalog.
No matter who you are in 2023 you know who Taylor Swift is, Times 2023 Person of the Year and new member of the billionaire club. The Eras Tour is an international phenomenon. Taylor Swift has spent the last few years rerecording her first 6 albums after her masters were sold off. These re-records of the albums and for the most part the same songs have become more popular than the originals, as shown in my project. 
We will look at all of her released music including the stolen versions and Taylor's Version up to Speak Now (Taylor's Version). We will look at the danceability and popularity of each album. We will look at whether danceability affects popularity or not.
